  <p>Actually we don't need to keep all CSS files in a single file.</p>
  <p>It would be much better to split them into smaller files and keep close to Views using those styles.</p>
  <p>We can also split <code>View</code> into more fine-grained classes: <code>Activities</code> and <code>Activity</code>.
